<h3> Project Aspire 25 </h3>

Part of our ICS 414 Software Engineering course II at UH Manoa, we have a client that wanted to have a comprehensive web application where it allowed respected users in the company to execute financial audits, projections, and more. The web application would replace their pen and paper operations. The client had very specific requirements. The web application should reflect the real world and the work that each member of the company. Therefore, the client had requested that roles be implmeneted to reflect their corporate structure. There woudl be an auditor, executive, admin, and analyst. Each role had a different data permisison for what each role is able to do, what each role is able to read and or write.

The auditor would be able to edit some data in the financial statements that are collected in database on the backened. But they were only able to write and read the outcomes of their inputs. Not the already existing data that is in the system. The executive role is able to toggle stress test on or off, toggle the total, and details about the graphs. Therefore, they are only able to read graphed and charted resultes in the SM. The admin is abel to asssign roles to users (similar to onboarding), creating new user, and deleteing existing users. They are able to read any user accounts and any data from the digital accounts that are made in order to provide new and existing users access to certain information. Finally, the analyst is able to write anything that has a green box in FC, stress test, and workpapers S1-S5B. Analysts are also able to read the SM. 

Given these roles we are given financial data, via excel sheet, where we need to connect to a backend database in order for the website to have data for each role to manipulate. This was the critical part of the web application as it was the bases for where work is going to be done.
