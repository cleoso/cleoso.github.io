## Intro
During my semester working on ICS 314, I learned a lot about coding that otherwise was foreign to me such as coding standards, design patterns, functional programming and ethics in software engineering. Moreever, I learned to be more cricital about the tools that I use in order to be a better software engineer. Interesting enough I took away some very critical lessons from this course of which I would like to reflect on. 

## Agile Project Management
During this course I knew that the team project nearing the end of the semester would be a struggle, managing a team is difficult. The difficulty of managing a team of college students are that for the project not all students are competent and have available resources to be able to dedicate either time or effort to the project. College students, like myself, have many other courses and although may not have the time to dedicate without being rigid and discipline in your time management, which lets face it happens rarely. 

What I've learned that critically helped me manage myself and our team was indeed a mini-lecture of project management risks. These risks included many of the known and unknown issues or risks when attempting to finish a project. Lots of what was covered was indeed very very useful information. For example, one such risk of projects are team skills and limited resources. Team skills pretains to the teams capabilities of doing what is requested by the project. If the team were not competent in some fashion it helped our team better give tasks that best suite their skillsets while also allowing them to work on other parts of the project if they felt they could help, with some oversight. Furthermore, a more critical and indeed a huge oversight of many projects that I ran into myself was not having clear requirements. This drastically changed my mindset about the project, not only as tasks but also as a whole. When tasks are given without clear instructions or guidance, then the task cannot be executed. The reason is that the context or the tasks isn't clearly stating the requirements for what it asks a member. Therfore increasing the time and effort to more about the tasks requirements than the actual tasks.

I was able to take many of these lessons in project management into my own personal life, currently I have been working on a small company that develops e-textiles, fabric that can communicate with technology using woven circuitry. The ability to have a e-textiles allows for fabric to communicate information or data from sensors or the fabric itself. For example, Tesla incorpartes this type of technology to determine positioning of objects on seats. The purpose was to create an algorigthm that predicted both the object on the seat, but also the position of the object. Later Tesla would further this algorithm to even predict the object and several other characteristics of the object such as male or female, height, wieght, if it was a baby, etc. Cool, so it call determine a person by contact whats the big deal. Well, the reason Tesla requires that data is because it allows the main computer of the car determine how much force and energy it needs to deploy airbags in a way such that it protects the object. Lots force goes into an airbag, detecting the object and predicting the appropriate force needed requires this information that the e-textiles that is woven into the car seat allows the car computer to determine. 

## Ethics in Software Engineering

While the industry of technology continues to be more and more elaborate, data privacy, securing data, and ethics are definitely at the forefront of how we implement new software. Although majority of the time our course work was indeed more focused on the execution of design patterns and existing code, not much of the course load discussed ethics. Clearly though it is common to expect that your fellow colleagues have the best intentions and do the job correctly. However, we make mistakes and sometimes have oversight of ethics. One such example is I am interning at NASA working on code that NASA requires for one of it's satelliates. I need help in determining the best solution for a object class that I am not sure of, instead of contacting my supervisor whom is currently in a meeting, I take it upon myself to find the answer of the code. Therefore, I share sensitive and proparitary code into an AI search, of which violates one of the security policies and ethics of NASA's agreement. Due to this violation, I am terminated from my position immediealty. Although, that scenario hasn't happened, it goes into showing the accidental ethics that is being violatd. However, an existing ethical violation that OpenAI has stated is that it will restict its use of AI from any activity that has a high risk of physical harm, including,” specifically, “weapons development” and “military and warfare,” The Intercept reports. The updated policy instead prohibits using "our service to harm yourself or others”. Knowing this, we can see that without ethics in the way we not only execute projects or code, we can semingly harm our users more. 

## Reflection on my journey 

So far, I have become more and more competent in my knowledge of coding structures and coding designs. Without these concepts I would have more of difficult time in being able to
