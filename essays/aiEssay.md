### I. Introduction


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

  2. In-class Practice WODs; Using AI in our practice WODS helped me understand the syntax and understand how things function. However, to accomplish this I would need to be explicit to the AI that I am a college student or learning the fundamentals of coding in order for the information to be relevant or meaningfull for me. AI was not good at interpreting this and was unable to identify the missing points in my code. While the AI was great at resolving the code, it wasn't good at being lazy, so majority of the answers code corrections or suggestions were overtly complicated and thus altered the entire framework of the code. Therefore, as I aspire to be an effective coder, I want to be do more while doing less, but the code presented as a solution to AI is more complicated and thus made my level of effeciency to be inconsistant and requring more energy.
