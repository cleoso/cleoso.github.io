## Introduction

Why does tracking matter, what could we gain from tracking, and what could we do with information? Tracking has been a way that our ancestors have been able to determine best course of actions like where to go, and gave more insight in the action to be better. Without tracking many things that are predictable would be left to chance. Imagine, if we were not able to keep record and be able to track down food sources would we have stand a chance agaisnt the elements. Ultimately, tracking provides us a track record of past things done in order for better effeciency. Why waste energy or time on things that are easily predictable and trackable? Therfore, tracking has been a cornerstone of the most important way we are able to determine what actions require better insight into in order to be more effecient.

## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The problem was more about what needed to be more effecient. In the case of programming, it provides insight about files, code, and coding that requires more resources or less. Without the tracking system we cannot identify what would need more resources, therefore the purpose of tracking is not sufficient in answering this issue. 


## In the context of project

In the case of our project, we seeked to track the estimation of effort in order to determine what functions required more effort and how we manage to executing the task. Without this estimation we couldn't be able to even begin to manage our time wisely. Once our team was able to break down the problem we decided to coordinate several tasks and assign them estimation of efforts.

This functino was setup through the 

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
