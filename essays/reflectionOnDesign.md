*Description*

Designing software is such an obscure and almost always defined differently everytime someone brings it up. For example, when I say that I have designed software, what part? What process could you have derived a code from? And so forth. In order for us to have a conversation of designing software we need to determine what it means to design, and what would that entail when discussing about the context of software engineering. 

What's its importance and how does having a design process benefit and no benefit us. Thus, we will discuss below those questions and attempt to derive an answer that best provides both clarity and reasonablness. 

## Context of design

Designing has always been a practical and natural thing we all do, but little do we get to appreciate the immense power it provides us. Its easy to see the designing process when it comes to actors, artists, or musical composers. Some of which have methods that are both odd and even extreme. Nonetheless, we all inheirnt a powerful tool at our disposal, to design. 

In all cases the designing follows a closed syntax, it first requires intent. Itent, is determined upon the person and the context of which the intent of action is meant for. Many articles online argue that in the context of design the intent is meant to resolve a problem. However, when artists create, is there a problem? Does it mean that all design derives from a problem? I argue no, simply because intent supercedes the context of the situation and the context is both mutable. Intent can be to resolve a problem in the context of a job, but it can also be to create a little piece of art that you wanted to do. The intent is more important than we think. Identifying this requires deep thought additionally requires intrapersonal conversations and external perspective. 

Secondly, design requires working memory or active memory. Active memory, is the act of utilizing references in our memory. This is important because it allows us to develop key links between past experiences and what we remember of it in order to serve us in the present. This is effortful, so it requires energy. 

Thirdly, design requires collaboration with others. Now oddly enough most people would argue that this principle is incorrect, that there are many expamples that we can reference where we presume that people were able to do things on their own. However, that is not the case in the process of design. When we design something, it is to achieve some ultaimte utility to yourself or others. Therefore, the designing process requires us to interact with those entities that ultimately benefit from the design. In human history, we have designed things for others and thus required to interact with them in order to make a design that suites the needs of the beneficiary. Therefore, do we really do anything alone and do we really achieve outcomes alone. No, not in the cases of designs and not in the case of many aspects of human life. We may do things alone, but we cannot acheive things without the collaboration of others.

Ultimately, design requires three main principalities intent, working memory, and collaboration. However, this serves as a main framework and therefore is subject to minor alterations, but nonethelss the sequence of design is unchanged.

## In the context of Software Engineering

Software engineering requires deisigning and lots of it. It is as simple as other tasks because it truly requires heavy active memory, which increases the energy usage of any person. Therefore, the third principle is critical in minimizing the pain and suffering of one person to design and to be able to get a design from a meta thought to acutality. In the case of software engineering, the actuality of the design can be iterated quickly allowing for us to make changes quickly.

Therefore, the majority of the pain and suffering is in the intent and collaboration. As we have found in the Man Myth model the more brains entangled into one subject suffers from the increased energy needed to both coordinate and be receptive to others thoughts. Therefore, the intent is needed to be clear and cannot change. The method of how to arrive to the intent may change however not the intent. 

Moreover, methods are mutable because it requires to be adaptable to different contexts, you wouldn't approach a hospital app as you would a military grade software. The needs of the client are different, but the intent remains similar, they have an issue with developing, creating, maintaing, and deploying new software.

There is something about the methods that we use that are similar in all cases, its patterns. Even the code language that we decide to develop software with follows a predictable syntax, that when broken, fails to render. Many patterns exists and are quite adaptable, which include creational design patterns, structural design patterns, and behavioral design patterns. 

## In the context of my work

In my recent work we are developing a full stack developed website that both stores and tracks data over the internet for a club manager for the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. Therefore, when I was looking at the
