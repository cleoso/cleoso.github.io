Cat and Physics
<hr>

Cat Physics is a python game that was created to mimic the real world physics in regards to gravity. Whilst also mimicing collisions with such gravity. I came to create this while taking a physics class while learning about Newton's gravity equation. Later I would come to across a video in which scientest experimented on cats in zero g's to determine whether they would fall to their feet.

Interestingly enough against intuition the cats experiencing zero g's were not able to land on their feet. What was suggested as to the reason, without the force of gravity acting on the cats their biological responses were not able to adjust to the weightlessness. Then it forced me to consider what it means to virutally mimic gravity, on a digital landscape. How, do you compute this and additional, how might you considere developing a virtual representation that is both accurate with gravity but also when it collides with other objects.

Then Cat Physics was born, taking a template from a previously developed code I coded the application by developing four things. First I needed to create and develop the space, in which the objects being represnted would fall. Second, I needed to create the objects themselves. I later chose the famous rainbow cat gif as my object and static black ball to allow for a collision. Thirdly I needed to create an initilizer to start the game. Finally when you play you simply need to click on the white space and the rainbow cat gif will appear, then it will experience gravity (depending on the settings). Once it hit the static ball it will simulate a collision with that gravity.

Later would like to add where the code will ask you what gravity from which planet you would like the cat to experience.
